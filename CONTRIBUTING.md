## Source Code Format

This project uses `.editorconfig` for consistent code formatting. JetBrains IDEs (Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA) will automatically follow these rules.

### Formatting Rules

| File Type         | Indent | Max Line Length |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------|
| Kotlin (*.kt/kts) | 2      | 120             |
| C/C++ (*.cpp/h)   | 4      | 120             |
| XML/JSON/YAML     | 2      | 120             |
| CMake             | 4      | 120             |

### Creating the Reformat Scope

The `.idea` directory is excluded by `.gitignore`, so you need to create the `Reformat` scope manually:

1. Open `Settings` -> `Appearance & Behavior` -> `Scopes`
2. Click `+` to add a new `Shared` scope
3. Name it `Reformat`
4. Set the pattern to:

```
file[Futon*]:*//*&&!file[Futon.app.main]:cpp/llama.cpp//*&&!file[Futon]:daemon/build//*
```

This pattern includes all project files but excludes the `litert_cc_sdk` directory (third-party code).

### Before Committing

Run the code formatter in JetBrains IDE:

1. Right-click on the `Project` root directory
2. Select `Reformat Code`
3. In the dialog, enable:
   - Optimize imports
   - Rearrange entries
4. Click `Filters` -> `Scope` -> select `Reformat` (the scope you created above)
5. Click `OK`
6. Run the formatter

This ensures all code follows the project's formatting conventions before submission.

## Contribution and Copyright

### License Agreement

By submitting code to this project (including Pull Requests), you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

### Attribution Guidelines

To maintain a clean codebase and respect intellectual property, please follow these guidelines for copyright headers:

#### Modifying Existing Files

If the file header lists three or fewer authors (including yourself):

Add your name to the Copyright line.

```
// Copyright (C) 2025 Fleey, [Existing Author], [Your Name]
```

If adding your name would exceed three authors:

Do not list a long name list. Generalize the author list instead.

```
// Copyright (C) 2025 Fleey, [Author A], [Author B], and contributors
```

#### Creating New Files

For completely original code:

Add your name with the project's standard license header.

```
// Copyright (C) 2025 [Your Name]
```

For files containing third-party or copyrighted content:

- Do not remove or modify the original copyright notice and license header
- Keep the original author information intact
- Do not add your name to avoid legal and copyright disputes
- You may add "Modified by [Your Name]" below the original notice to indicate your modifications, but never overwrite the original author's copyright

#### Documentation and Other Changes

For documentation, configuration files, or simple typo fixes, do not add attribution in the file. Your contributions will be recorded in the Git commit history.
